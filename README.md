# RPG text game

Text game with Java Core.

# _The game logic is as follows:_ #
- Once the game starts, the user receives a "welcome" message and is starting to "create" his character (picking the character's name, his weapon).
- After entering the asked input, the objects of class Player and Monster will be initialized, setting the other fields using random generated values.
- Once the objects are created, a random number of "waves" is generetated through which the player must go through, each wave with a new monster.
- During the game, the player has access to options such as attacking the enemy, drinking a healing potion, seeing the current status and quitting the game.
